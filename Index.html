  <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Your Name">

  <p>I was born and raised in the small state of Rhode Island. I graduated from Rhode Island College with a Bachelors degree in Health Science.
    I am currently a data analytics student at the Georgia Tech Bootcamp course and plan to shift gears in my career and become a health data analyst.
    My dream job would be to work in the CDC. I have a passion for public health and hope to make an impact in the future in my course of work.

  </p>
  <p>I also enjoy traveling, cooking, reading, hiking and watching sports in my freetime. Being around family and friends is very important to me.
    Being new to the city of Atlanta is very different. I love the choice of activities available to do outdoors and the weather is also fantastic.
